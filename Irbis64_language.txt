explaining of irbis64 formatting language:

functions and uniforms and their C# equivalents:

^ - This uniform is used to change the case of text. For example, ^t will capitalize the first letter of each word in the title. In C#, you can use the ToTitleCase method of the TextInfo class to achieve the same effect.

# - This uniform is used to insert a sequence number. For example, # will insert the current record number. In C#, you can use a loop to generate a sequence of numbers and insert them into the output.

| - This uniform is used to insert a separator between two values. For example, |a^b will insert a space between the values of the a and b fields. In C#, you can use the String.Join method to concatenate a list of values with a separator.

@ - This uniform is used to insert the current date or time. For example, @d will insert the current date in the format YYYYMMDD. In C#, you can use the DateTime.Now property to get the current date and time and format it using the ToString method.

! - This uniform is used to insert a fixed value. For example, !text will insert the string "text". In C#, you can simply include the desired text in the output.

? - This uniform is used to insert a conditional value. For example, ?a^b will insert the value of the a field if it exists, and the value of the b field otherwise. In C#, you can use the ternary operator (? :) to achieve the same effect.

^ - This function is used to remove diacritical marks from text. For example, ^a will remove all diacritical marks from the value of the a field. In C#, you can use the String.Normalize method with the NormalizationForm.FormD option to remove diacritical marks.

& - This function is used to truncate text to a certain length. For example, &10a will truncate the value of the a field to 10 characters. In C#, you can use the String.Substring method to achieve the same effect.

= - This function is used to compare two values. For example, =a^b will insert the value of the a field if it is equal to the value of the b field, and nothing otherwise. In C#, you can use the == operator to compare two values.

() - This function is used to group multiple functions or uniforms together. For example, (a^|b) will insert the value of the a field followed by a space and then the value of the b field. In C#, you can use parentheses to group multiple operations together.

"LAST" function: This function is used to get the last character of a string. An example of using this function in C# would be:

string str = "hello world";

char lastChar = str[str.Length - 1];

"EMPTY" function: This function is used to check if a string is empty. An example of using this function in C# would be:

string str = "";

bool isEmpty = string.IsNullOrEmpty(str);

"REPLACE" function: This function is used to replace a substring in a string with another substring. An example of using this function in C# would be:

string str = "hello world";

string replacedStr = str.Replace("hello", "hi");

if - this function is used to perform conditional statements in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the if statement.

mfn - this function is used to specify the record number in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the int data type.

format - this function is used to format a record in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.Format method.

val - this function is used to extract a value from a record in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.Split method.

empty - this function is used to check if a field is empty in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.IsNullOrEmpty method.

lcase - this function is used to convert a string to lowercase in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.ToLower method.

ucase - this function is used to convert a string to uppercase in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.ToUpper method.

len - this function is used to get the length of a string in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.Length property.

trim - this function is used to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.Trim method.

repeat - this function is used to repeat a string a specified number of times in Irbis64. The equivalent in C# is the string.Concat method.

It's worth noting that while some of these functions have direct equivalents in C#, others may require more complex logic to achieve the same result. Additionally, some of the functions listed may not be applicable in all scenarios. As such, it's important to carefully consider the specific use case and determine the appropriate approach.

formatting and processing bibliographic data, as well as for creating reports and performing other tasks related to library management.

There are many more functions available in the Irbis64 format language, and you can find a comprehensive list in the Irbis64 documentation.

In terms of C# equivalents, many of the functions in the Irbis64 format language have similar counterparts in C#. For example:

ADD - use the + operator to add values

FORMAT - use the ToString() method with a format string to format a date or time value

IF - use the if statement to perform a conditional operation

MAX - use the Math.Max() method to return the maximum value of a set of values

MIN - use the Math.Min() method to return the minimum value of a set of values

N - use the int.Parse() or double.Parse() method to convert a string to a number

REPLACE - use the Replace() method to replace a substring with another substring

SIZE - use the Length property to return the size of a string

SUBSTR - use the Substring() method to return a substring of a string

TAG - use the string.Substring() method to return the tag of a field or subfield

UPPERCASE - use the string.ToUpper() method to convert a string to uppercase

 for creating and manipulating bibliographic records, generating reports, and customizing user interfaces.

The Irbis64 formatting language has a rich set of built-in functions and unifors, which are special commands used for formatting data. Some examples of functions and unifors in Irbis64 include:

if - a conditional statement that allows you to perform different actions based on a condition.

C# equivalent: inputString.Substring(1);

$ - Removes the last character of a string.

C# equivalent: inputString.Substring(0, inputString.Length - 1);

@ - Returns the first character of a string.

C# equivalent: inputString[0];

C# equivalent: inputString.PadLeft(10, '0'); (pads with leading zeros to a length of 10)

( and ) - Formats a string as a substring.

C# equivalent: inputString.Substring(startIndex, length);

Here are 10 examples of functions and UNIFORS in IRBIS64 along with their C# equivalents:
